# 283. Move Zeroes

```
FacebookMicrosoftAppleAmazonYandexGiven an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 
Constraints:
	- 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 104
	- -231 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 231 - 1
